\section{Redox processes: Electron transfer and changes in oxidation number (oxidation states)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Identify the oxidising and reducing agents, by reference to electron transfer and change oxidation number
    \item Oxidation number/state : Number given to an atom or ion in a compound describing how oxidised or reduced it is. Oxidation states must be written accompanied by either a "+" or a "-" sign.
    \item Use change of oxidation number to balance a chemical equations given the species in an chemical equations.
    \item Disproportionation reaction : A redox reaction in which the same species undergoes oxidation and reduction simultaneously.
\end{itemize}
