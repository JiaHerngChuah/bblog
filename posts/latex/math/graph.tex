\section{Graph Terminologies}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \vocab{Graph} is an ordered pair $G = (V,E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges, i.e. the connections between vertices.
    \item \vocab{Order} of a graph is the number of vertices, denoted as $\abs{V}$.
    \item We say $G' = (V',E')$ is a \vocab{subgraph} of $G = (V,E)$ if $V' \subseteq V$ and $E' \subseteq E$.
    \item A graph is \vocab{directed} if every edge has a direction. The edge may be represented as $(u,v)$, where $u,v$ are vertices.
    \item A graph is \vocab{undirected} if there is no direction for any edge. The edge may be represented as $\{u,v\}$ where $u,v$ are vertices.
    \item A graph is \vocab{simple} if there is no multiple edges (between any two vertices, there can be at most 1 edge) and self-loop (every edge must have different endpoints).
    \item \vocab{Degree} of a vertex $v$, denoted as $\deg(v)$, is the number of edges incident to $v$.
\end{itemize}



\section{Well-known Results}

\begin{theorem}[Hall's Marriage Theorem]
Let $G = (V,E)$ be a bipartite graph with sets of vertices $A$ and $B$. There exists a perfect matching between $A$ and $B$ if and only if for every $X \subseteq A$, we have
\[\abs{N(X)} \ge \abs{X}\]
\end{theorem}
